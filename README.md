# MVP toolkit - Mission Visualisation and Planning toolkit

MVP toolkit is a GUI using the NASA JPL HORIZONS database to visualize any object's path known in the solarsystem. 
It is a hobby project, managed by a single person and mostly for educational purposes. The goal is to make a Programm for early
spacemission planning phases (phase 0/A) with tools to calculate porkchopplots, rendeszvous and fictional encounters including 
preliminary delta-V calcultations.
